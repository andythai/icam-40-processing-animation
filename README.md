# Animation

**Material/Medium of the Project:** Processing Animation (Java)

**Date of Completion:**  May 5, 2015

This is an animation made in Processing, which depicts a pulsating circle that has extra bouncing balls spawn with every pulsation. 

As the middle centered circle reaches its minimum size, it then grows in size and becomes filled with black holes. This piece was focused mainly on conveying the emotion of anger with stress. The various colors throughout the animation (shades of red), were picked to convey this feeling of escalating anger to a breaking point where everything goes loose.
